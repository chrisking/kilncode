# Notes:

Nassim Nicholas Taleb wrote Antifragile, a book advocating we ourselves become antifragile, or that we become better trhough chaos and disorder around us.

Many have claimed that we have the ability to build software that itself is antifragile, including such techniques as continuous integration, 0 downtime migrations, and elaborate failover mechanisms. 

In this post I will argue that these endeavors, while they certainly improve software for all parties, they in no way create antifragile software. Additionally I will argue the best we can hope for is resilience or robustness in our codebases, and that is OK.
